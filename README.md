# Incubit: Incubation Monitoring System.

The goal of this project is to provide an efficient and accurate way to track the temperature and humidity levels inside an incubator to ensure optimal hatching conditions for the eggs. 

This project involves the use of a temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11) to monitor the conditions inside of a chicken egg incubator. The sensor is connected to a microcontroller (NodeMCU) which is used to transmit the collected data to a database on a computer. A web-based dashboard is also developed to display the data in real-time, providing an easy way for users to monitor the conditions inside the incubator.
