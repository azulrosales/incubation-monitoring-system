# Incubit: Incubation Monitoring System.

The goal of this project was to provide an efficient and accurate way to track the temperature and humidity levels inside an incubator to ensure optimal hatching conditions for the eggs. 

This project involved the use of a temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11) to monitor the conditions inside of a chicken egg incubator. The sensor was connected to a microcontroller (NodeMCU) which was used to transmit the collected data to a database on a computer. A web-based dashboard was also developed to display the data in real-time, providing an easy way for users to monitor the conditions inside the incubator.
